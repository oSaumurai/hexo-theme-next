For the PBR and soft shadow, I recreated the pipeline with OpenGL. The ray tracing is currently using simple brute force path tracing.

#### <center>About me</center>

It is a great opportunity that I can take the graphics course since the graphics are the core part of the game engine. I remember that I joined this course a little late and I was surprised when you asked me if I was here to fill up hour points for this semester. I found myself enjoying computer graphics studying and projects. During the course, I earned good grades on both projects and exams. The mathematics and algorithms are interesting in the graphics area. It is also helpful that you shared the knowledge of random number algorithms when talking about procedural generation. For labs, I actively tried the solution for extra questions.  

I am enthusiastic about engine technologies. My passion for this area, and software development at large, was cultivated while participating in the 2D Mario game where I was fascinated by the design and construction of a system that coordinated several subsystems like object management, level loader, camera, audio, HUD, animation, and collision systems. After working in different positions, I realize I am truly interested in this field. Thus, I am  preparing the experience for entering the related industries. 

In order to become an engine engineer, I recently taught myself Vulkan and game engine frameworks by leveraging resources such as Jason Gregory’s “Game Engine Architecture”. Except for engine building, I understand that there are a lot of interesting graphics topics to be covered. My current plan is to keep exploring topics like volumetric cloud, post effect and water simulation, meanwhile using the Vulkan API to make a working render engine and using it for my own convenience before September.

For the future study, I will add audio system, simplified 3-D collection detection system, and a 3-D level editor to make a deliverable game demo. Some VFX study with Unreal and Houdini might be helpful.
